# my-portfolio

## Description

This project was to create a personal work portfolio to help me with the task of finding employment. This portfolio will have links and images to varies other projects that I have created so that I may market myself and my skill to future employers. I also have my contact information on this project so that employers who are interested in interviewing me for an open position can reach me.
